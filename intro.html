    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Everything started with a smaller planet with the name of Pestelgia. Pestelgia was a magical world filled with many creatures that only exist in worlds that we presume as fantasy or mythical. To them, it’s the opposite. In Pestelgia, one individual is as real as the next, and to them it’s the creatures who identify themselves as humans who might be considered fantasy.</p>

    <p>This magical world has more hidden secrets than just creatures such as fairies or dragons. The creatures of Pestelgia all have magical powers that are given to them by the Sacred Gemstones. Five exist of the precious stones. Each one is given their own element of fire, water, air, earth, or darkness/light by the 6 spirits. The spirits are what is worshiped and what is considered the creators of life. The gems are their special artifact that represent the silent spirits. The civilization split themselves into five empires corresponding to their Elemental Gem. Each empire consists of one city of the main element, and one or more smaller villages that are sub-elements. Each element city has a castle where the royal family guards and protects the elemental stone in a confidential location.</p>

    <p>Each gemstone by itself, is very powerful. Without their presence, no one knows what would happen, or what would happen if they are gathered in the same vicinity. For all they know, all may be lost with an upcoming darkness that would seek only power, and possibly cause the end of all civilization.</p>
