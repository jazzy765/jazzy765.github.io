    <h1>Chapter 1:</h1>
    <h2>A Gift Worth Giving</h2>

    <p> It was a typical and beautiful day in Ponunnia, the village of plant magic. The sun glistened above, the birds chirped, and the sound of little children playing filled the ears of many. Even the blossoms and leaves on the trees danced in the playful breeze. </p>
    <p>However, not everyone was enjoying the sunny weather. A red-haired man grumbled as he wobbled and stumbled his way home from the village’s bar. Once inside, he slammed the door, his eyes directed to his son. “Kecyl? What do you think you are doing?” His tone had a slight irritation weaving through his words. </p>
    <p>“Sennalhi's friend's birthday party should be over by now. I am heading out now,to go pick her up,” a boy with the same shade of red hair and tan skin stated.</p>
    <p>The old man breathed heavily, his words slurred, and his breath was scented with alcohol. "Why have you not already gone to do so then?!" he exclaimed.</p>
    <p>Kecyl folded his wolf ears on top of his head in displeasure at the smell, but he then left quickly before his father could say anything else or get any angrier. Once the front door closed behind him, the red-headed wolf boy let out a sigh. Sadness was in his eyes, and he was definitely aware of the reason why. </p>
    <p>Kecyl quickly covered up his distress as he walked through the village. His reasoning was that he had to remain strong for his little sister. She was too young to know of all the wicked things in the world, or at least the faults of some of the individuals that are inhabiting Pestelgia. </p>
    <p>Walking up to a cute, cozy, and welcoming house, Kecyl knocked on the front door. The tall teen was greeted by a smiling face of an elder female harpy. “Well, hello there! You must be the big brother that little Sennalhi has been boasting about all day. It’s great to finally meet you! After all their time together at the school and in the village’s meadow, I’ve heard so much about you,” The women immediately welcomed Kecyl in, and he could see his sister laughing with her friend and throwing paper streamers at the other girl. </p>
    <p>His smile could not be contained as he saw them playfully interacting and displaying their childhood innocence. “I am assuming she wasn’t too much of a hassle then?” He inquired, he already could assume her answer, but he just wanted to be positive.</p>
    <p>"Oh, what nonsense! This little girl is such a sweet little blossom! The joy she brings is contagious! I am sincerely astonished by the raising that took place in sculpting her into being such a delight that she is today!” The woman said with a smile. With such an uplift, Kecyl's pride was boosted a little and he found delight in the praise of raising Sennalhi. </p>
    <p>In no time at all, the wolf teen felt two little arms tightly wrap around him and cling to him. “BIG BROTHER!!!” exclaimed a little, higher-pitched voice. When he turned around, Kecyl kneeled down to her level and embraced her. The little wolf's reaction was innocent and accompanied by a cheerful giggle. “I had so much fun! And it’s not just because there was cake!” she playfully joked. The women behind them smiled in response.</p>
